# Pastel

Pastel is an Xcode 4 colour and font theme, designed for (Objective -)C , originally based on the [Railscast TextMate Theme](http://railscasts.com/about) for Ruby, which in turn, was based on the [Idlefingers Theme](http://idlefingers.co.uk/).

## Installation

To install the theme move it into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/`, creating any directories you need to along the way.

At some point, if I ever get round to it, I will create a proper installer. For now though, you will have to move it yourselves.

## Fonts

I have purposely not chosen a font for the theme, I have set it to use Xcode's default `Menlo`. It is easy enough to change it to your preferred font in the `Fonts and Colors` pane in the Xcode preferences.

## Soâ€¦ What does it look like?!

I have added a quick screenshot which I feel is fairly representative, if anyone has any suggested open source files that would be a good demo to screenshot do say.
